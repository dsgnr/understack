# understack

An opinionated installation of OpenStack and related services to
be able to provision bare metal hardware to be consumable by
[genestack](https://github.com/rackerlabs/genestack) for the
full OpenStack suite.

The requirements are a Kubernetes cluster, which
this repo will contain information about building different
clusters and then a pile of bare metal systems that can
be ingested into the stack to be available to be consumed
via Openstack Ironic.
